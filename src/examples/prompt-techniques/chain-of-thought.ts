1. Initially, Roger has 5 tennis balls.
2. He buys 2 cans of tennis balls.
3. Each can contains 3 tennis balls.
4. So the 2 cans contain 2 Ã— 3 = a total of 6 tennis balls.
5. Now I need to add the initial number of balls to the new ones: 5 + 6 = 11.

Therefore, Roger has 11 tennis balls in total.`,

  expectedOutput: `Let me trace through this code step by step:

1. The function \`calculate_average\` takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It initializes a variable \`total\` to 0.
3. It loops through each number in the list and adds it to the total.
4. It then returns the total divided by the length of the list.

The first example works correctly:
- Input: [10, 20, 30, 40]
- Total: 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100
- Length: 4
- Output: 100 / 4 = 25.0

The second example fails because:
- Input: []
- Total: 0 (no numbers to add)
- Length: 0
- Output: Attempts to calculate 0 / 0, which causes a ZeroDivisionError

The error is caused by trying to divide by zero when the input list is empty. To fix this, we should add a check for empty lists:

\`\`\`python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return 0  # or return None, or raise a custom exception
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)
\`\`\`

This prevents the division by zero by returning a default value when the list is empty.`,
