# Deployo-
Deployo  -  is your always-on pair-programmer. 
A generative chat interface with in-depth knowledge on modern web technologies. It can provide technical guidance while building on the web, generate UI with client-side functionality, write and execute code in  Python, build diagrams explaining complex programming topics, and more. Prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web and mobile apps. 


Core Features Implemented:

XML-based response structure with thinking and response sections
Multilingual support that maintains user's language while preserving code in English
Enhanced code blocks with rich metadata (project, file, description, environment)
MDX component integration including LinearProcessFlow, Quiz, math expressions, and complexity analysis
Python-exclusive focus with clear technology stack expertise

Advanced Capabilities:

Intelligent project structure inference from code snippets
LangChain debugging assistance with specialized support for AI/ML pipelines
Security policies with clear refusal patterns for harmful or out-of-scope requests
Chain of thought integration for transparent reasoning
Complete deployment workflows from development to production

Technical Stack Emphasis:
The prompt prioritizes modern Python tools like FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, LangChain, Poetry, and Docker, while maintaining expertise across the full Python ecosystem.
The system prompt is designed to make Deployo act as a senior Python developer who can handle everything from quick code snippets to complex full-stack applications, with particular strength in AI/ML integration and deployment practices.
